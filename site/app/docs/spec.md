## Why BIPSO?  

With BLE, manufacturers can build up their applications by using the SIG-defined Characteristics or by their own private GATT definitions. It is quick and flexible, but sometimes sacrifices the compatibility between BLE products.  

_Imagine a scenario that you are a BLE light bulb user, you've got some in your home, and you are happy to control lights with your smartphone APP._  

> Unfortunately, there is a bulb broken today, and you have to buy a new one for the replacement. However, you couldn't find a bulb that is the same as those you are using in your house. It left you with no choice but to buy a new one manufactured by another company.  
>  
> When you are back home, you find out that your current APP is simply not working with the new light bulb you just installed. Then, you download the specific APP made for your new bulb, and now it's working.  
> 
> Soon, you find it annoying switching between different APPs in order to control those light bulbs made by different brand names, that is not cool. You feel so frustrated with your BLE lights and, of course, your many BLE APPs on your smartphone.  

BIPSO is born to solve this problem of consistency and compatibility for BLE applications. It defines a set of BLE Characteristics that follows the [IPSO Smart Object Guideline](http://www.ipso-alliance.org/smart-object-guidelines/) for developers to build their applications with an unified data model. You don't have to worry about how to map a real-world gadget into BLE Characteristics, IPSO and BIPSO have modeled many for you.  

BIPSO is trying to let you operate all BLE gadgets with only a single smartphone APP, and let BLE gadgets be IPSO-compatible.
