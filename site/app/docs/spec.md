## Why BIPSO? 

With BLE, manufacturers can build up their application by using the SIG-defined Characteristics or by their own private GATT definitions. It is quick and flexible, but sometimes sacrifices compatibility between BLE products.  

_Imagine a scenario that you are a BLE light bulb user, you've got some in your home, and you are happy to control lights by your smartphone APP._  

> Today, a bulb is broken and you're going to buy a new one for change. You find no bulb as same brand as those in your house, and you make your mind to buy a new one manufacturered by another brand.  
>  
> When you are home, install the new one on the wall, and you find that your current APP is just not working with the new one. Then, you download another specific APP for your new bulb, and now it's working.  
> 
> Soon, you find that switching APPs for controlling those lights is kind of annoying, that is not cool. You feel so frustrated with your BLE lights and, of course, your smartphone BLE APPs.  

BIPSO is born to solve this problem of consistency and compatibility for BLE applications. It defines a set of BLE Characteristics that follows the [IPSO Smart Object Guideline](http://www.ipso-alliance.org/smart-object-guidelines/) for developers to build their applications with an unified data model. You don't have to worry about how to map a real-world gadget into BLE Characteristics, IPSO and BIPSO have modeled many for you.  

What BIPSO is doing is to trying to let you operate all BLE gadgets with only a single smartphone APP, and let BLE gadgets be IPSO-compatible.
